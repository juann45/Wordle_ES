# Wordle_ES

(v 1.0)
Just a basic version of Wordly game (this version is currently spanish only)

Please ensure you have the libraries installed on your system

You can select the length of the word and the number of tries you'll have. Upon entering them, you'll be prompted to type a word with that length. You'll receive the following feedback:

The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was.

If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot.

If the tile turns yellow, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.

If the tile turns red, the letter is not in the word.

Please go to releases page and get the python file, make sure you got the libraries installed
